#     rabbitmq:
#         # There is a prebuilt RabbitMQ image; see
#         # https://hub.docker.com/_/rabbitmq/ for details.
#         # This variant is built on Alpine Linux (it's smaller) and includes
#         # the management UI.
#         image: 'rabbitmq:3.9-management-alpine'

#         # These ports are exposed on the host; 'hostport:containerport'.
#         # You could connect to this server from outside with the *host's*
#         # DNS name or IP address and port 5672 (the left-hand side of the
#         # colon).
#         ports:
#         # The standard AMQP protocol port
#             - '5671:5672'
#         # HTTP management UI
#             - '15671:15672'

#         # Run this container on a private network for this application.
#         # This is necessary for magic Docker DNS to work: other containers
#         # also running on this network will see a host name "rabbitmq"
#         # (the name of this section) and the internal port 5672, even though
#         # that's not explicitly published above.
